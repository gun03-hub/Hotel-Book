## Usage

### Navigating Sections
- The user can scroll through various sections of the website or use the navigation menu to jump to specific sections like "About Us" and "Special Offers."
- The footer contains links to navigate through the page sections, which will smoothly scroll the user to the corresponding section.

### Adding Content
- **Images:** All images for destinations, hotels, and offers are stored in the `public/assets/img` directory.
- **Text Content:** To modify the text content, edit the respective component files under `src/components/`.

### Customization
- **Colors and Styling:** All the styles are located in CSS files under the `src/` directory. You can modify the look and feel of the webpage by editing the corresponding `.css` files (e.g., `HeroSection.css`, `Testimonials.css`).
- **Adding New Sections:** You can add new sections by creating new components and linking them within the `App.js` file.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building UI components.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Structure and styling of the webpage.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic and dynamic content rendering.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

## Future Improvements

- **Backend Integration:** Connect to a hotel booking API to make the search functionality fully functional.
- **User Authentication:** Implement sign-in and sign-up features for users to create and manage accounts.
- **Booking System:** Allow users to book hotels directly from the platform with integrated payment options.
